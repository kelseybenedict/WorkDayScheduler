# WorkDayScheduler

 ## Description
 The purpose of this project is to create a work day planner that saves your events even after the page is refreshed. Additionally, the work day is color coded based on what time it is during the day. A grey background on the text field is considered a past event, a red background on the text field is considered a present event, and a green background on the text field is considered a future event. All events are saved into local storage and displayed once the "save" button is selected after typing in an event. Additionally, the date and time is displayed under the title of the page using moment.js. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
In order to use this application, simply enter text in the text box for it's corresponding time and click the "save" button to save the event.
